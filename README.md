# Life-Expectancy-Report-using-Python-and-Power-BI
Analyzing global life expectancy trends and health factors using WHO dataset. Cleaned and analyzed with Python. Offers insights for improving population health. #DataAnalysis #Healthcare

I have used the life expectancy data set provided by who but that dataset had a lot of missing values. Therefore i had to transform the data using python and then again after importing the data into power bi i was encountering some data type issues which i handled with power query.

I have added all the necesary files in this repo.
I have also added a findings.txt file which shoes the results of this thourough analysis.
Hope you will like my work :)
